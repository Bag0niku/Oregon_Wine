I mean, who says that to someone they just met and as the owner you should know better than to treat a customer so rudely. My husband brushed it off and acted maturely by not responding back, but then later the owner AGAIN says my husband “needs to check his color palette” because Saj thought the sky looked orange during the 2020 fires and after my husband made a comment on how red the sky looked. Such childish jabs and insults for no reason. I don’t know how my husband kept his cool, but I’m glad he did.

As a member of Harvest Host, we stayed  the night in our motorhome overlooking the South Umpqua River.

Freed Estate Vineyards grow the grapes that produce their wines. I tasted noteworthy vintages from 2014, 2016 and 2018 with my favorite from their 2018 crops. For my palate it was a fabulous year for many of their wines. However,  their newly released 2016 Tempranillo is exceptional.

It is a family run estate and my list of favorable adjectives to describe this family is lengthy.  I found our wine expert, Brian, to be extremely  knowledgeable, welcoming and a pleasure to talk with. I was lucky to meet a few of his family, as well.

The savoir vivre is my favorite red of them all. A silky, well-balanced Pinot noir with warm cherry notes and just the right amount of dryness. I paired it with a braised duck the other night and it was absolutely delightful.

For white, their Pinot Gris is my go-to. Acidic, fruit forward, bright, refreshing- perfect wine for a hot, sunny day. I love how well-rounded it is because it’s something both my Chardonnay and Sav blanc drinking friends can enjoy. Personally, I think it goes best with a nice seafood or spicy Thai dish.

Not to mention the grapes are organically grown and their wine is certified as salmon safe. So if you’re an environmentally conscious wine lover,  you’re in the right place!

Thank you, Sue, for taking such great care of us! We ordered flights which was very fun. I'm usually a red wine drinker but the whites were not too sweet so I enjoyed them more than usual. The highlight, though, was the queen bee bubbly! There's some sort of process with their own bees that feeds the yeast that are little balls on the bottom. I think, I don't really remember the science, but it was freakin' amazing! One of the best sparkling wines of my life. We also got a couple charcuterie boards which was packed with tasty snacks and cheeses (the onion one was !!! so good, followed by the merlot as my fav). They were very accommodating to keep the nuts in a separate bowl because I'm allergic. Though they were out of the Italian meats, the turkey panini with aoli was incredibly flavorful and filling. The service was amazing. Sue was very knowledgeable, attentive but not intrusive, and seemed infested in us having an amazing experience. The scenery is beautiful as well, I didn't know this part of Oregon had a big wine scene (I lived down here for a year six years ago but I was just back visiting).

They were super accommodating with all my decorations and considerations for the comfort of our group - especially with Covid still on the mind! We were able to feel safe and secure while enjoying our family experience! They provided the canopies, tables and chairs. The Homestead Picnic area was beautifully picturesque with Hood in the distance as the backdrop for the Vineyard (on a clear day at least)!

And did I mention the wine?  Lynette treated us to tastings of all their very best wines and had a special bottle waiting for my Dad when he arrived.  I especially enjoyed the Chardonnay and brought a bottle home to remember our time!  Quite a few of my family members bought additional bottles on our way out as we thanked Lynette for her hospitality!

The only thing to be aware of is that the drive up is very steep on a gravel road (to be expected at a Vineyard!) so bring your vehicle that can grip the road on the way up.  But the reward at the top of the hill is MORE than worth it.

Just do it.  Enjoy the wine and enjoy the view.

- we first sat outside, but we were told to move because they were ""expecting a group""
- we could not seat elsewhere outside because there was no shade and it was noon.
- we asked to move two seats about three feet to be in the shade and our request was rejected.
- charcuterie board was not available as you have to pre-order them 24 hours beforehand.
The person was just highly unpleasant and made us feel we were not welcome.

Love that they are an estate winery so every wine you taste is grown by them.

One downside was that our table on the patio was right next to the pick up spot for the wine club members so there were about 10 cars or so that pulled up (most left running) next to us while we were at our tasting, which the car noise and exhaust was just not the vibe we had expected (felt like we were sitting IN the parking lot) so that detracted slightly from the experience.

The provisions platter (aka charcuterie board) was amazing. Came with three substantial portions of cheese, three meats, many accompaniments and they even offered gluten free crackers! Was not expecting that but was so grateful.

The weather got a little warm during our tasting and our server mentioned that the red wines weren't best served outdoors in the heat, which made us feel like we may not have been getting the optimal experience, however all the wines were exceptional and I definitely recommend checking it out.",1630904129,False,ChIJYUZE8AI9lVQRTAz6NWyDEk0
