The visit was all inside even though it was a lovely warm day, the inside is dark and not very warm + welcoming more like a dank neglected cabin but it looks like they're currently renovating that space 🤷‍♀️ The person pouring was a little dazed? Would disappear for chunks of time with no warning, didn't give us much information and was a bit all over the place and at the end when we went to pay and another reservation had showed up as well and there was a couple that was halfway through-- no one was to be found and we all awkwardly waited for >15 minutes for someone to appear. But at the the of the day we were there for the wine! Our tasting experience was ok, wines were all only very old vintages and marked up $50-90+ more than previously because they were old but honestly for me these  10+ year wines were not really holding up and felt quite thin and oxidized and very fruit forward which isn't my preferred style for pinots so take my review with that large caveat. We bought a couple cases at other places this one was just a huge miss for us and we preferred to pay for the tasting ($100 out of pocket)-- then take anything home. Would have preferred to taste some more recent releases that could be cellared.",1653419759,False,ChIJY_YvLqs_lVQRQ1JGKPCC-qA

As a member of Harvest Host, we stayed  the night in our motorhome overlooking the South Umpqua River.

Freed Estate Vineyards grow the grapes that produce their wines. I tasted noteworthy vintages from 2014, 2016 and 2018 with my favorite from their 2018 crops. For my palate it was a fabulous year for many of their wines. However,  their newly released 2016 Tempranillo is exceptional.

It is a family run estate and my list of favorable adjectives to describe this family is lengthy.  I found our wine expert, Brian, to be extremely  knowledgeable, welcoming and a pleasure to talk with. I was lucky to meet a few of his family, as well.

Beautiful grounds including two outdoor patios that are open on the weekends (one open during the week) and an indoor tasting area. Love that they are an estate winery so every wine you taste is grown by them.

One downside was that our table on the patio was right next to the pick up spot for the wine club members so there were about 10 cars or so that pulled up (most left running) next to us while we were at our tasting, which the car noise and exhaust was just not the vibe we had expected (felt like we were sitting IN the parking lot) so that detracted slightly from the experience.

The provisions platter (aka charcuterie board) was amazing. Came with three substantial portions of cheese, three meats, many accompaniments and they even offered gluten free crackers! Was not expecting that but was so grateful.

The weather got a little warm during our tasting and our server mentioned that the red wines weren't best served outdoors in the heat, which made us feel like we may not have been getting the optimal experience, however all the wines were exceptional and I definitely recommend checking it out.",1630904129,False,ChIJYUZE8AI9lVQRTAz6NWyDEk0

We elected to park in the front so my mom could use her scooter and enter the winery at an entrance that had a small ramp. It was incredibly difficult for her to enter as the parking lot is gravel. However, we made it in and were immediately greeted very rudely being told that we needed to move our car. The rude woman who was working stated that other customers wouldn't be able to enter, which they could, our car was not blocking ANY entrances. They only thing it was blocking was her view out the window. She then suggested we park next to the entrance with the stair (NOT A RAMP) when I reminded her that it was easier for my mother to get in and out on the side with the ramp that did not have a parking spot. Another lovely woman provided the tasting for us and was incredibly kind. I think she could tell that her coworker was being rude, or has had to deal with her attitude in the past. Regardless, I will not be back to this winery due to their lack of consideration for disabled persons.

What a unique experience! Literally a wonderland to lose yourself in. I've been to quite a few wineries but nothing like this. There is always something fun and pleasing to the eye to explore around the corner. Games are set up throughout the gardens like cornhole toss, mini golf, mazes, and a musical playground. Cozy and beautiful lounging chairs are hidden along the pathways like a secret garden all to yourself to sit and drink your wine while you enjoy the flowers. Beautiful sculptures and artwork everywhere. Everything has a story. There are even song suggestions to listen to for all the wines. There's outdoor seating where dogs are allowed. Also there's a dog park. Our server Judy was fantastic and the woman working the gift shop and museum was so kind and friendly. The owner is so very interesting, genuine, and fun to talk to. This really is a very interesting and fun experience. I would also like to add that I was immediately warmly greeted with a smile each time I entered a building by the attentive staff. Ps If you have a kid who has phobias of statues or mannequins then the museum isn't the place for them lol.

The food and wine was wonderful. I got the only vegan option on the menu and was not disappointed. I was thoroughly impressed by the vegan quinoa sandwich. It was very fresh and flavorful. I really enjoyed my wine selections. The only dairy free or vegan options for kids are the steak fries. So if you have a kiddo with an allergy to dairy bring them something to snack on.

I visited the tasting room when it was located in Carlton, and had a lovely experience.. I loved the wine I loved the setting, and I loved the service I received. I joined their wine club with a 4 case/year commitment.
Recently the tasting room moved to McMinnville. The space is very lovely. The wine is still delicious.
Unfortunately, every time I have made  reservations and taken friends and other potential members there with me, we have not been treated very kindly. This last time was the final straw. The room was mostly empty, and we asked if our party of 4 could sit in a more comfortable setting where we could chat and enjoy our wines. We were told the space was reserved and waiting for people who had yet to show up, and it is busy on Sundays for member pick up. I told her, I am a member, also here for my pickup. She was so shocked and taken aback by this, she actually reacted as if she had been slapped. It didn't change her mind at all, and so we sat where they told us. The space we requested sat empty for the entirety of our visit. We were treated like second class citizens and they couldn't wait for us to leave. We had to ask for more water, we waited long periods between tastings, and in the end, they still didn't seem to understand I was an actual member of their wine club. They did not ask us if we wished to purchase anything, or ask us what we thought of the wine. But they were sure to keep asking if there was anything else we needed as they moved my shipment closer and closer to me - once they got it right. .
With so many options available I will not be returning to Troon. My Membership has been cancelled, my experience shared with them, and now with you, and I will take my newly available wine budget to a place that appreciates their members.",1646080354,False,ChIJeeQKRWI4lVQRAbyV6ExOZkE

Lynette and Bob were the most gracious hosts and treated us like family.  They were super accommodating with all my decorations and considerations for the comfort of our group - especially with Covid still on the mind! We were able to feel safe and secure while enjoying our family experience! They provided the canopies, tables and chairs. The Homestead Picnic area was beautifully picturesque with Hood in the distance as the backdrop for the Vineyard (on a clear day at least)!

And did I mention the wine?  Lynette treated us to tastings of all their very best wines and had a special bottle waiting for my Dad when he arrived.  I especially enjoyed the Chardonnay and brought a bottle home to remember our time!  Quite a few of my family members bought additional bottles on our way out as we thanked Lynette for her hospitality!

The only thing to be aware of is that the drive up is very steep on a gravel road (to be expected at a Vineyard!) so bring your vehicle that can grip the road on the way up.  But the reward at the top of the hill is MORE than worth it.

Just do it.  Enjoy the wine and enjoy the view.

Thank you Lynette and team!

This one came recommended but we were terribly disappointed. We arrived a little bit after 11am. We were the only ones there. The man behind the counter we found to be inattentive, and gave me the feeling that he felt very ""put out"" having to deal with us (there was only 2 of us). This was a vast contrast from the welcoming and friendly atmosphere we had experienced at other places so far. The tasting room is crowded with wine barrels and equipment, the view up at the winery is beautiful so we opted to sit outside. Every time we went in for our next tasting he just poured it and then didn't tell us anything about it....what winery doesn't tell you about what you are drinking? This man just couldn't be bothered. I only liked the Syrah but ended up not buying anything (this was the only place I didn't purchase anything). The tasting itself was pricey $20.00 - more than I paid anywhere else.

The savoir vivre is my favorite red of them all. A silky, well-balanced Pinot noir with warm cherry notes and just the right amount of dryness. I paired it with a braised duck the other night and it was absolutely delightful.

For white, their Pinot Gris is my go-to. Acidic, fruit forward, bright, refreshing- perfect wine for a hot, sunny day. I love how well-rounded it is because it’s something both my Chardonnay and Sav blanc drinking friends can enjoy. Personally, I think it goes best with a nice seafood or spicy Thai dish.

Not to mention the grapes are organically grown and their wine is certified as salmon safe. So if you’re an environmentally conscious wine lover,  you’re in the right place!

All of the courses were stunning, and we were impressed by how well the coursed paired with selected wines. I really enjoyed the surprising flavours and textures that Sarah experimented with - especially the diced pear with chanterelles and pasta.

Like always, the atmosphere is quite inviting, and Fullerton's patio is just a lovely place to sit with friends, food, and wine.

Our group did have some feedback, though:
1. The service experience could be improved. We were approached and served by almost all staff (whom we love), but being served by one server plus the winemaker would have been a better experience than being served by several people.
2. The ambience/aesthetic should be improved. Silverware was often forgotten about, and placed in a rush - often incorrectly. Glassware was often also placed weirdly, and it would be nice to have a dump cup for wine. Further, getting better quality silverware (Ikea flatware was used) would be a great improvement to complement the nice plates used.
3. Since it was not too busy, it would have been awesome to have the Chef come out to introduce the courses, or to chat with us after finishing the food. The cadence in which courses came was also a little too fast, since we often were not finished courses or wine tastings before the next item was brought to us. There were also a few times where servers did not know what they were serving, so having one person as the go-to for course overviews would be better.
4. Improving the table experience would be nice. Including table cloths and black linens and decluttering the table would have been nice, since there were a few decorations, and the candle was never lit.

Otherwise, I would totally recommend this experience to anyone who wants to enjoy amazing seasonal food with some great local wine. Thank you so much for launching this experience - we cannot wait to see what comes next!",1663959120,False,ChIJOdxWwY4NlVQRqwTEexRZfJo

Cons:
- While the winery is beautiful it has the same fault as all many of the newer wineries, sterile, lack of character, almost cookie cutter design
- The wine is overpriced. When your intro Pinot is $65, you’ve priced yourself out. There are way too many good wines for less to waste time here. This is a personal issue I have with the newer wineries (especially those backed by the mega producers)

I've heard so many good things from friends about this winery, but it was ruined right from the start by the discourteous host.
We parked in the side parking lot and wandered around the back deck admiring the view. We eventually meandered inside through the back door, and checked out the impressive interior of the tasting room.
The host couldn't be bothered to greet us upon entering, and stood at the host stand the entire time after we entered. We were the only people in the inside area at the time, and only one 3 top seated outside.
When we approached the fella, he asked if we'd ever been there before.
I said no, but I'd heard good things.
He said we'd obviously not been there before because we ""came in the wrong way.""
Didn't realize there was a right and wrong way to approach this place, so we immediately felt that his attitude was wholely unnecessary.
He never once looked at either of us directly, which I thought was a bit pretentious, but his pompous attitude made us feel unwelcome from the outright.
After opting to sit outside, he instructed my friend and I to go find a table and someone would be out shortly.
We sat at our table and waited, and waited, waited some more, and watched another young lady tend to the 3 top table outside that was already established before we arrived. No hospitality was directed towards my friend and I.
We waited over 15 minutes before the same host finally came to our table and brought some water. It was a hot Southern Oregon afternoon, so I felt the wait for hydration was a bit intentional by our trollish little host friend to make us feel totally unwelcome.
Regardless, we were quite hungry after having a pleasant river float that afternoon, but also wanted to enjoy a few flights of wine.
Again, I've never visited this winery but have heard good things.
He told us that the food service was over for the day, which we thought was odd since they weren't closing for over another hour.
Ultimately, we opted to leave at that point because the service was so poor, and this dude's attitude was less than accommodating.
This review is coming from a 25+ year service/ hospitality industry worker, so I hate to leave a bad review, but this was worthy of a negative review if I could.
If any of my staff EVER acted this way towards patrons they would be out of a job.
Plain and simple.
The smarmy, condescending attitude was too much from the host, blatant horrible service, and I'll make it a point to steer others away from visiting this establishment in the future. 👎👎👎",1660898562,False,ChIJV4EakXaJxVQRF83dTo7CS3k

We went to the flying Dutchman winery planning on getting a tasting on a fine afternoon. In fact, we planned our entire day around a relaxing afternoon tasting some good wine.

Within 3 minutes, we experienced enough rudeness that we decided to leave.

We walked in to wait to be served in a line only to have the server yell, ""OUT THE WAY, COMING THROUGH"" in a very rude tone while we were minding our business in line.

We disregarded it, even though he could have kindly said excuse me.

Then when we were at the front of the line, we mentioned that our hotel had said that we could get complimentary tastings... He rudely said, ""We are not affiliated with them and can't control what they tell you."" And then walked to the next customer without giving us time to respond.

We would have happily paid for the tasting had the server just said nicely that sorry, but they are no longer doing that promotion.

Instead he just rudely scowled at us and didn't even give us a chance to order.

So we left. Will never come back. And are leaving with a terrible taste in our mouth.

This valley, like the Rogue Valley in southern Oregon, provides a warmer wine growing climate. Los Rocosos grapes have an added advantage. They are grown in the dark basalt soil that makes up the Rock District of Milton-Freewater. The Rock District is unique because of its cobblestone-rich soil that allows the vines to root deeper while the dark soil absorbs more solar radiation.  In addition to being a Viticoltore, Roger and Lucinda offer B&B accommodations at this working vineyard. If you are so lucky as to get a reservation, insist Roger make his amazing oatmeal porridge.

The guy who came was able to get one of the dogs caller and contacted the owner.
He was very patient with the owner. Owner wasn’t home.

The controllers first instinct wasn’t to just take the dogs, but to try to get them where they should be.
It’s Christmas Eve so it would suck to have your dogs in a pound through the holidays.
He did give the owner a warning and told them they have to find the hole the dogs are using to get out.
