Caity took great care of us and was incredibly accommodating with our various wine preferences. The patio was well shaded and spaced and the price points were very affordable. The cheese plate came with a whole block of cheese and a full bag of crackers, which we supplemented with our own jam and fixings.

All of the courses were stunning, and we were impressed by how well the coursed paired with selected wines. I really enjoyed the surprising flavours and textures that Sarah experimented with - especially the diced pear with chanterelles and pasta.

Like always, the atmosphere is quite inviting, and Fullertons patio is just a lovely place to sit with friends, food, and wine.

Our group did have some feedback, though:
1. The service experience could be improved. We were approached and served by almost all staff (whom we love), but being served by one server plus the winemaker would have been a better experience than being served by several people.
2. The ambience/aesthetic should be improved. Silverware was often forgotten about, and placed in a rush - often incorrectly. Glassware was often also placed weirdly, and it would be nice to have a dump cup for wine. Further, getting better quality silverware (Ikea flatware was used) would be a great improvement to complement the nice plates used.
3. Since it was not too busy, it would have been awesome to have the Chef come out to introduce the courses, or to chat with us after finishing the food. The cadence in which courses came was also a little too fast, since we often were not finished courses or wine tastings before the next item was brought to us. There were also a few times where servers did not know what they were serving, so having one person as the go-to for course overviews would be better.
4. Improving the table experience would be nice. Including table cloths and black linens and decluttering the table would have been nice, since there were a few decorations, and the candle was never lit.

Otherwise, I would totally recommend this experience to anyone who wants to enjoy amazing seasonal food with some great local wine. Thank you so much for launching this experience - we cannot wait to see what comes next!",1663959120,False,ChIJOdxWwY4NlVQRqwTEexRZfJo

The help do not know their liquor history or background and tell you that what they do not have in stock you can go down the road and by at the liquor store.
To top this all off as I was leaving after being thoroughly disenchanted by the selection they had and being mislead by the websites information as well as coming all the way from Klamath Falls, they had me pay them to try the poor selection of spirits they had.

We were able to feel safe and secure while enjoying our family experience! They provided the canopies, tables and chairs. The Homestead Picnic area was beautifully picturesque with Hood in the distance as the backdrop for the Vineyard (on a clear day at least)!

And did I mention the wine?  Lynette treated us to tastings of all their very best wines and had a special bottle waiting for my Dad when he arrived.  I especially enjoyed the Chardonnay and brought a bottle home to remember our time!  Quite a few of my family members bought additional bottles on our way out as we thanked Lynette for her hospitality!

The only thing to be aware of is that the drive up is very steep on a gravel road (to be expected at a Vineyard!) so bring your vehicle that can grip the road on the way up.  But the reward at the top of the hill is MORE than worth it.

Just do it.  Enjoy the wine and enjoy the view.

Freed Estate Vineyards grow the grapes that produce their wines. I tasted noteworthy vintages from 2014, 2016 and 2018 with my favorite from their 2018 crops. For my palate it was a fabulous year for many of their wines. However,  their newly released 2016 Tempranillo is exceptional.

It is a family run estate and my list of favorable adjectives to describe this family is lengthy.  I found our wine expert, Brian, to be extremely  knowledgeable, welcoming and a pleasure to talk with. I was lucky to meet a few of his family, as well.

I visited the tasting room when it was located in Carlton, and had a lovely experience.. I loved the wine I loved the setting, and I loved the service I received. I joined their wine club with a 4 case/year commitment.
Recently the tasting room moved to McMinnville. The space is very lovely. The wine is still delicious.
Unfortunately, every time I have made  reservations and taken friends and other potential members there with me, we have not been treated very kindly. This last time was the final straw. The room was mostly empty, and we asked if our party of 4 could sit in a more comfortable setting where we could chat and enjoy our wines. We were told the space was reserved and waiting for people who had yet to show up, and it is busy on Sundays for member pick up. I told her, I am a member, also here for my pickup. She was so shocked and taken aback by this, she actually reacted as if she had been slapped. It didnt change her mind at all, and so we sat where they told us. The space we requested sat empty for the entirety of our visit. We were treated like second class citizens and they couldnt wait for us to leave. We had to ask for more water, we waited long periods between tastings, and in the end, they still didnt seem to understand I was an actual member of their wine club. They did not ask us if we wished to purchase anything, or ask us what we thought of the wine. But they were sure to keep asking if there was anything else we needed as they moved my shipment closer and closer to me - once they got it right. .

My mother is handicapped and is bound to a scooter and we arrived we noticed there were no marked disabled parking spaces and the only parking spaces near entrances did not have a ramp but a small stair. We elected to park in the front so my mom could use her scooter and enter the winery at an entrance that had a small ramp. It was incredibly difficult for her to enter as the parking lot is gravel. However, we made it in and were immediately greeted very rudely being told that we needed to move our car. The rude woman who was working stated that other customers wouldnt be able to enter, which they could, our car was not blocking ANY entrances. They only thing it was blocking was her view out the window. She then suggested we park next to the entrance with the stair (NOT A RAMP) when I reminded her that it was easier for my mother to get in and out on the side with the ramp that did not have a parking spot. Another lovely woman provided the tasting for us and was incredibly kind. I think she could tell that her coworker was being rude, or has had to deal with her attitude in the past. Regardless, I will not be back to this winery due to their lack of consideration for disabled persons.

What a unique experience! Literally a wonderland to lose yourself in. Ive been to quite a few wineries but nothing like this. There is always something fun and pleasing to the eye to explore around the corner. Games are set up throughout the gardens like cornhole toss, mini golf, mazes, and a musical playground. Cozy and beautiful lounging chairs are hidden along the pathways like a secret garden all to yourself to sit and drink your wine while you enjoy the flowers. Beautiful sculptures and artwork everywhere. Everything has a story. There are even song suggestions to listen to for all the wines. Theres outdoor seating where dogs are allowed. Also theres a dog park. Our server Judy was fantastic and the woman working the gift shop and museum was so kind and friendly. The owner is so very interesting, genuine, and fun to talk to. This really is a very interesting and fun experience. I would also like to add that I was immediately warmly greeted with a smile each time I entered a building by the attentive staff. Ps If you have a kid who has phobias of statues or mannequins then the museum isnt the place for them lol.

The food and wine was wonderful. I got the only vegan option on the menu and was not disappointed. I was thoroughly impressed by the vegan quinoa sandwich. It was very fresh and flavorful. I really enjoyed my wine selections. The only dairy free or vegan options for kids are the steak fries. So if you have a kiddo with an allergy to dairy bring them something to snack on.

The H chardonnay was super intriguing, with flavors and characters that I would not automatically associate with chardonnay. It turns out these characteristics are not uncommon in Oregon chardonnay. Oaky in the nose, lightly oaky on the palate, which is always intriguing to me.

The 2014 Hammacher pinot noir is lots of fun with tobacco, leather, dark plum, and 3 or 4 other flavors that I never quite identified. This will require more study.

We walked in to wait to be served in a line only to have the server yell, ""OUT THE WAY, COMING THROUGH"" in a very rude tone while we were minding our business in line.

We disregarded it, even though he could have kindly said excuse me.

Then when we were at the front of the line, we mentioned that our hotel had said that we could get complimentary tastings... He rudely said, ""We are not affiliated with them and cant control what they tell you."" And then walked to the next customer without giving us time to respond.

We would have happily paid for the tasting had the server just said nicely that sorry, but they are no longer doing that promotion.

Instead he just rudely scowled at us and didnt even give us a chance to order.

The savoir vivre is my favorite red of them all. A silky, well-balanced Pinot noir with warm cherry notes and just the right amount of dryness. I paired it with a braised duck the other night and it was absolutely delightful.

For white, their Pinot Gris is my go-to. Acidic, fruit forward, bright, refreshing- perfect wine for a hot, sunny day. I love how well-rounded it is because it‚Äôs something both my Chardonnay and Sav blanc drinking friends can enjoy. Personally, I think it goes best with a nice seafood or spicy Thai dish.

We parked in the side parking lot and wandered around the back deck admiring the view. We eventually meandered inside through the back door, and checked out the impressive interior of the tasting room.
The host couldnt be bothered to greet us upon entering, and stood at the host stand the entire time after we entered. We were the only people in the inside area at the time, and only one 3 top seated outside.
When we approached the fella, he asked if wed ever been there before.
I said no, but Id heard good things.
He said wed obviously not been there before because we ""came in the wrong way.""
Didnt realize there was a right and wrong way to approach this place, so we immediately felt that his attitude was wholely unnecessary.
He never once looked at either of us directly, which I thought was a bit pretentious, but his pompous attitude made us feel unwelcome from the outright.
After opting to sit outside, he instructed my friend and I to go find a table and someone would be out shortly.
We sat at our table and waited, and waited, waited some more, and watched another young lady tend to the 3 top table outside that was already established before we arrived. No hospitality was directed towards my friend and I.
We waited over 15 minutes before the same host finally came to our table and brought some water. It was a hot Southern Oregon afternoon, so I felt the wait for hydration was a bit intentional by our trollish little host friend to make us feel totally unwelcome.
Regardless, we were quite hungry after having a pleasant river float that afternoon, but also wanted to enjoy a few flights of wine.
Again, Ive never visited this winery but have heard good things.
He told us that the food service was over for the day, which we thought was odd since they werent closing for over another hour.
Ultimately, we opted to leave at that point because the service was so poor, and this dudes attitude was less than accommodating.
This review is coming from a 25+ year service/ hospitality industry worker, so I hate to leave a bad review, but this was worthy of a negative review if I could.
If any of my staff EVER acted this way towards patrons they would be out of a job.
Plain and simple.
The smarmy, condescending attitude was too much from the host, blatant horrible service, and Ill make it a point to steer others away from visiting this establishment in the future. üëéüëéüëé",1660898562,False,ChIJV4EakXaJxVQRF83dTo7CS3k

The reservation was really easy as they had openings all day long, but its not what we were told when we arrived:
- we first sat outside, but we were told to move because they were ""expecting a group""
- we could not seat elsewhere outside because there was no shade and it was noon.
- we asked to move two seats about three feet to be in the shade and our request was rejected.
- charcuterie board was not available as you have to pre-order them 24 hours beforehand.
The person was just highly unpleasant and made us feel we were not welcome.
We simply left without tasting.
We went to two wineries close by and has a wonderful rest of our day.

Love that they are an estate winery so every wine you taste is grown by them.

One downside was that our table on the patio was right next to the pick up spot for the wine club members so there were about 10 cars or so that pulled up (most left running) next to us while we were at our tasting, which the car noise and exhaust was just not the vibe we had expected (felt like we were sitting IN the parking lot) so that detracted slightly from the experience.

The provisions platter (aka charcuterie board) was amazing. Came with three substantial portions of cheese, three meats, many accompaniments and they even offered gluten free crackers! Was not expecting that but was so grateful.

The weather got a little warm during our tasting and our server mentioned that the red wines werent best served outdoors in the heat, which made us feel like we may not have been getting the optimal experience, however all the wines were exceptional and I definitely recommend checking it out.",1630904129,False,ChIJYUZE8AI9lVQRTAz6NWyDEk0

It was a great place to relax, take in the view, and drink some good wine on a sunny day. (The neighbors dog was cute, too.) We will definitely stop again at Redhawk!",1599188977,False,ChIJBd9R3m5VlVQRJSvShvfhv2A

The owners were cheerful and gracious. Had a small problem with the hot-water, and the owners came and fixed it ASAP...very nice people. Suffice it to say the ambiance was incredible, and both the Pinot Noir Blanc & Rose were as well. Thank you so much to the Rasmussen Family we cant wait to come back.",1617207972,False,ChIJO1uPS8VNlVQRNmzjlceDf1s

The visit was all inside even though it was a lovely warm day, the inside is dark and not very warm + welcoming more like a dank neglected cabin but it looks like theyre currently renovating that space ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The person pouring was a little dazed? Would disappear for chunks of time with no warning, didnt give us much information and was a bit all over the place and at the end when we went to pay and another reservation had showed up as well and there was a couple that was halfway through-- no one was to be found and we all awkwardly waited for >15 minutes for someone to appear. But at the the of the day we were there for the wine! Our tasting experience was ok, wines were all only very old vintages and marked up $50-90+ more than previously because they were old but honestly for me these  10+ year wines were not really holding up and felt quite thin and oxidized and very fruit forward which isnt my preferred style for pinots so take my review with that large caveat. We bought a couple cases at other places this one was just a huge miss for us and we preferred to pay for the tasting ($100 out of pocket)-- then take anything home. Would have preferred to taste some more recent releases that could be cellared.",1653419759,False,ChIJY_YvLqs_lVQRQ1JGKPCC-qA
