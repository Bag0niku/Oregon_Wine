# Oregon_Wine
Wine recommender for Oregon wines

## Overview
Using Oregon Wine as the theme, this project will be a team project combining attributes from projects completed in the last few months.

### Contributors:
- Shaobobei
- MichaylaGilchrist
- DarrinM37

## Data
Data Sources are still being determined, some webscraping will be involved.

## Goals for the Final Product:
- Landing page / Index Page   (still do not know what this will be, could be reviews page, the map...etc)
- About Us Page
- Wine FAQ and FYI Page
- Reviews Page that can be filtered, Reviews of wines or Vinyards... Still undecided. (resembles UFO project)
- Wine/vinyard recommender page based on a few inputs including: Red/White, Budget, sweet/Dry
- Map Page: Map of Oregon Vineyards Locations (Vacation Itinerary/weather/Earthquake projects)
    - can be filtered based on the recomender output or apply your own filtering.
- Data will be hosted on AWS cloud service
- Once finished website will be hosted on AWS S3 with the domain:  https://www.oregonvineyards.wine/

## Tasks
To get off start and form a clearer picture of our goal we need data. 
- Wine FAQ and FYI will be gathered by MichaylaGilchrist
- Wine Reviews will be gathered by Shaobobei and DarrinM37
- Vineyard and Winery locations will be gathered by Bag0niku (myself)
