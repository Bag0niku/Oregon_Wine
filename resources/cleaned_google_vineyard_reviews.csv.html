Caity took great care of us and was incredibly accommodating with our various wine preferences. The patio was well shaded and spaced and the price points were very affordable. The cheese plate came with a whole block of cheese and a full bag of crackers, which we supplemented with our own jam and fixings.
One complaint would be some dogs off leash and one recommendation is to label the single stall restrooms as gender neutral.
Otherwise, we enjoyed our time and hope to visit again soon!</td>

The culinary program here is remarkable. You can go for a standard tasting and order from a small pantry menu. This menu is much more then just charcuteries (which they have too), great option for lunch.
They also offer a Provisions tasting which is multi courses all sourced from their biodynamic farm. The quality of ingredients is wonderful and rotates seasonally.
There sparkling brute rose is one of my favorites. Post tasting you can see stunning 360 views of the valley. Soter is some special for sure.</td>

              <td>After hearing about the wine and food pairing menu created by the amazing Sarah Pliner, a few friends and I finally were able to attend.
All of the courses were stunning, and we were impressed by how well the coursed paired with selected wines. I really enjoyed the surprising flavours and textures that Sarah experimented with - especially the diced pear with chanterelles and pasta.
Like always, the atmosphere is quite inviting, and Fullertons patio is just a lovely place to sit with friends, food, and wine.
Our group did have some feedback, though:
1. The service experience could be improved. We were approached and served by almost all staff (whom we love), but being served by one server plus the winemaker would have been a better experience than being served by several people.
2. The ambience/aesthetic should be improved. Silverware was often forgotten about, and placed in a rush - often incorrectly. Glassware was often also placed weirdly, and it would be nice to have a dump cup for wine. Further, getting better quality silverware (Ikea flatware was used) would be a great improvement to complement the nice plates used.
3. Since it was not too busy, it would have been awesome to have the Chef come out to introduce the courses, or to chat with us after finishing the food. The cadence in which courses came was also a little too fast, since we often were not finished courses or wine tastings before the next item was brought to us. There were also a few times where servers did not know what they were serving, so having one person as the go-to for course overviews would be better.
4. Improving the table experience would be nice. Including table cloths and black linens and decluttering the table would have been nice, since there were a few decorations, and the candle was never lit.
Otherwise, I would totally recommend this experience to anyone who wants to enjoy amazing seasonal food with some great local wine. Thank you so much for launching this experience - we cannot wait to see what comes next!</td>

              <td>The owner, Saj Jivanjee, was very rude to my husband. It was the first time we met him and he left a very bad impression on us both. My husband made a comment, in front of others sitting at our table, that he was not aware of certain shows being performed in London (mind you, it was our FIRST time in London) and the owner of this winery says to my husband verbatim “that is ignorance of the highest caliber”. I mean, who says that to someone they just met and as the owner you should know better than to treat a customer so rudely. My husband brushed it off and acted maturely by not responding back, but then later the owner AGAIN says my husband “needs to check his color palette” because Saj thought the sky looked orange during the 2020 fires and after my husband made a comment on how red the sky looked. Such childish jabs and insults for no reason. I don’t know how my husband kept his cool, but I’m glad he did. We said our goodbyes to the other couple and walked away from that offensive and rude man.
We will not be returning to this establishment and do not wish to support someone’s business who carries themselves like this man does.

This is one of the few wineries to have older vintages on their standard flight (up to 10 years old) which gives you an opportunity to compare how different years and age effect the wine.

However, what makes this winery truly special is the tasting room manager Dave.
He is incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and welcoming. He makes every visit feel feel personal and comfortable. We recommend visiting here just for the great experience he will give you. (again not to mention how wonderful the wine is)

Double Mountain Hopped Whiskey is only made on a limited basis and I was told they sold out a month ago back in September 2021.
The website they have seems to be lacking in being updated, possibly bait and switch?, their whiskey is nothing special and the tasting room has fruit flies buzzing around and landing in your tasting glasses. The help do not know their liquor history or background and tell you that what they do not have in stock you can go down the road and by at the liquor store.
To top this all off as I was leaving after being thoroughly disenchanted by the selection they had and being mislead by the websites information as well as coming all the way from Klamath Falls, they had me pay them to try the poor selection of spirits they had. The whole trip up to see Hood River Distillers was a complete fail and would have been even worse if I hadnt already visited the New Basin Distillers in Madras which is everything great that Hood River Distiller is not and worth the drive. Oh and New Basin doesnt charge you anything for trying their samples.</td>

They were super accommodating with all my decorations and considerations for the comfort of our group - especially with Covid still on the mind! We were able to feel safe and secure while enjoying our family experience! They provided the canopies, tables and chairs. The Homestead Picnic area was beautifully picturesque with Hood in the distance as the backdrop for the Vineyard (on a clear day at least)!
And did I mention the wine?  Lynette treated us to tastings of all their very best wines and had a special bottle waiting for my Dad when he arrived.  I especially enjoyed the Chardonnay and brought a bottle home to remember our time!  Quite a few of my family members bought additional bottles on our way out as we thanked Lynette for her hospitality!
The only thing to be aware of is that the drive up is very steep on a gravel road (to be expected at a Vineyard!) so bring your vehicle that can grip the road on the way up.  But the reward at the top of the hill is MORE than worth it.
Just do it.  Enjoy the wine and enjoy the view.
Thank you Lynette and team!

As a member of Harvest Host, we stayed  the night in our motorhome overlooking the South Umpqua River.
Freed Estate Vineyards grow the grapes that produce their wines. I tasted noteworthy vintages from 2014, 2016 and 2018 with my favorite from their 2018 crops. For my palate it was a fabulous year for many of their wines. However,  their newly released 2016 Tempranillo is exceptional.
It is a family run estate and my list of favorable adjectives to describe this family is lengthy.  I found our wine expert, Brian, to be extremely  knowledgeable, welcoming and a pleasure to talk with. I was lucky to meet a few of his family, as well.
If you get the opportunity, buy a bottle of wine and sit along the river.</td>

Im not sure which was more lovely, the views or the wines. Even without adding alcohol, this place promotes inner peace. If you have the opportunity, you really do need to sit on the patio and take in the view with a glass of your favorite wine. The pictures I took really dont do this place justice. Seriously.

I visited the tasting room when it was located in Carlton, and had a lovely experience.. I loved the wine I loved the setting, and I loved the service I received. I joined their wine club with a 4 case/year commitment.
Recently the tasting room moved to McMinnville. The space is very lovely. The wine is still delicious.
Unfortunately, every time I have made  reservations and taken friends and other potential members there with me, we have not been treated very kindly. This last time was the final straw. The room was mostly empty, and we asked if our party of 4 could sit in a more comfortable setting where we could chat and enjoy our wines. We were told the space was reserved and waiting for people who had yet to show up, and it is busy on Sundays for member pick up. I told her, I am a member, also here for my pickup. She was so shocked and taken aback by this, she actually reacted as if she had been slapped. It didnt change her mind at all, and so we sat where they told us. The space we requested sat empty for the entirety of our visit. We were treated like second class citizens and they couldnt wait for us to leave. We had to ask for more water, we waited long periods between tastings, and in the end, they still didnt seem to understand I was an actual member of their wine club. They did not ask us if we wished to purchase anything, or ask us what we thought of the wine. But they were sure to keep asking if there was anything else we needed as they moved my shipment closer and closer to me - once they got it right. .
With so many options available I will not be returning to Troon. My Membership has been cancelled, my experience shared with them, and now with you, and I will take my newly available wine budget to a place that appreciates their members.</td>

My mother is handicapped and is bound to a scooter and we arrived we noticed there were no marked disabled parking spaces and the only parking spaces near entrances did not have a ramp but a small stair. We elected to park in the front so my mom could use her scooter and enter the winery at an entrance that had a small ramp. It was incredibly difficult for her to enter as the parking lot is gravel. However, we made it in and were immediately greeted very rudely being told that we needed to move our car. The rude woman who was working stated that other customers wouldnt be able to enter, which they could, our car was not blocking ANY entrances. They only thing it was blocking was her view out the window. She then suggested we park next to the entrance with the stair (NOT A RAMP) when I reminded her that it was easier for my mother to get in and out on the side with the ramp that did not have a parking spot. Another lovely woman provided the tasting for us and was incredibly kind. I think she could tell that her coworker was being rude, or has had to deal with her attitude in the past. Regardless, I will not be back to this winery due to their lack of consideration for disabled persons. The way we were treated here put a damper on the celebration of my parents 42nd wedding anniversary.</td>

The views from the deck are heavenly, the history that Diane shared with us was so interesting - especially since we had known some of the Nemarnik family.  Diane is following her childhood dream after watching prior family members make wine (for their families).  We were treated to 6 different wines and she patiently explained the difference.  She also had huge sandwiches, nuts, olives, cheese to enjoy during our leisurely wine tasting afternoon.  I HIGHLY recommend this very enjoyable experience.</td>

The wine was great!  The service was attentive enough and knowledgeable without detracting from my visit with the members that invited me.

Our guide was very good, she had passion and was having fun with us.  Their views outside are what you hope for with a great picture point amongst the vines. Their Noirs... those are incredible. Friends loved the sparking Rose they had, but the Noir was what I went home with.  Whole place is ran well, clean and classy and when the wine goes down, it goes down oh-so-smooth.</td>

The location is stunning - with the production facility and the outdoor seating looking east down the river below.  Couple this with a glass of wine and you have a wonderful place to spend part of an afternoon and to pick up a few bottles to take home.  We are primarily red wine drinkers, but in my opinion, the standout here is a white Albariño variety.  Its mostly found in Northwest Spain, but was a pleasant surprise to find it being made locally.
Unless you cross the river near Portland, there are toll bridges involved in visiting AniChe, but a few bucks extra is well worth it for excellent wine and glorious views.  FYI - if you crossed the river from the city of Hood River, and are headed back towards Portland, taking Rt 14 along the Washington side of the river and either crossing back at the Bridge Of The Gods, or going all the way to I 205 is a great drive.</td>

What a unique experience! Literally a wonderland to lose yourself in. Ive been to quite a few wineries but nothing like this. There is always something fun and pleasing to the eye to explore around the corner. Games are set up throughout the gardens like cornhole toss, mini golf, mazes, and a musical playground. Cozy and beautiful lounging chairs are hidden along the pathways like a secret garden all to yourself to sit and drink your wine while you enjoy the flowers. Beautiful sculptures and artwork everywhere. Everything has a story. There are even song suggestions to listen to for all the wines. Theres outdoor seating where dogs are allowed. Also theres a dog park. Our server Judy was fantastic and the woman working the gift shop and museum was so kind and friendly. The owner is so very interesting, genuine, and fun to talk to. This really is a very interesting and fun experience. I would also like to add that I was immediately warmly greeted with a smile each time I entered a building by the attentive staff. Ps If you have a kid who has phobias of statues or mannequins then the museum isnt the place for them lol.
The food and wine was wonderful. I got the only vegan option on the menu and was not disappointed. I was thoroughly impressed by the vegan quinoa sandwich. It was very fresh and flavorful. I really enjoyed my wine selections. The only dairy free or vegan options for kids are the steak fries. So if you have a kiddo with an allergy to dairy bring them something to snack on.
Make a day of your visit so you can take your time to soak everything in. Its beautiful, fun, and quirky.</td>

The wine is not expensive (I see another review that stated that)  reasonable for a Valley Pinot.  They had $28 bottles, that is really low.  Our wine was around $30 which I thought was a great deal. So many choices of seating areas and live music was just getting started but apparently happens most every night!  Service was top notch.

We were the only ones there. The man behind the counter we found to be inattentive, and gave me the feeling that he felt very &quot;put out&quot; having to deal with us (there was only 2 of us). This was a vast contrast from the welcoming and friendly atmosphere we had experienced at other places so far. The tasting room is crowded with wine barrels and equipment, the view up at the winery is beautiful so we opted to sit outside. Every time we went in for our next tasting he just poured it and then didnt tell us anything about it....what winery doesnt tell you about what you are drinking? This man just couldnt be bothered. I only liked the Syrah but ended up not buying anything (this was the only place I didnt purchase anything). The tasting itself was pricey $20.00 - more than I paid anywhere else. I personally would not go back here, with so many to choose from there is no reason. Hope others have a better experience.</td>

This winery does their craft well and the customer service was just as good. Im a shy and awkward person so Im not good with talking with people, but the woman who rang me up was very sweet.

              <td>Andrew, at the tasting room, was super helpful, friendly and let us down the paths of both both tastings that were offered. The story behind Hammacher is so fun. Its kind of like a boutique version of Ponzi, which is close by and shares the same origin story.
The H chardonnay was super intriguing, with flavors and characters that I would not automatically associate with chardonnay. It turns out these characteristics are not uncommon in Oregon chardonnay. Oaky in the nose, lightly oaky on the palate, which is always intriguing to me.
The 2014 Hammacher pinot noir is lots of fun with tobacco, leather, dark plum, and 3 or 4 other flavors that I never quite identified. This will require more study.
Definitely leaving with 2015 Belize Vineyard Eola, Amity Hills, and the 2014 previously mentioned.
Thank you so much for your hospitality and guidance,  Andrew.</td>

We went to the flying Dutchman winery planning on getting a tasting on a fine afternoon. In fact, we planned our entire day around a relaxing afternoon tasting some good wine.
Within 3 minutes, we experienced enough rudeness that we decided to leave.
We walked in to wait to be served in a line only to have the server yell,&quot;OUT THE WAY, COMING THROUGH&quot; in a very rude tone while we were minding our business in line.
We disregarded it, even though he could have kindly said excuse me.
Then when we were at the front of the line, we mentioned that our hotel had said that we could get complimentary tastings... He rudely said,&quot;We are not affiliated with them and cant control what they tell you.&quot; And then walked to the next customer without giving us time to respond.
We would have happily paid for the tasting had the server just said nicely that sorry, but they are no longer doing that promotion.
Instead he just rudely scowled at us and didnt even give us a chance to order.
So we left. Will never come back. And are leaving with a terrible taste in our mouth.
We come to this area often and will never visit this winery. You go to a winery to have a relaxed and pleasant experience; not to be yelled at and rudely treated</td>

We had the pleasure to briefly speak with Ayla who shared her and Jackson’s wonderful story. For younger winemakers, their products are truly impressive, and their tasting experience is one of a kind. I’d stack the products from their family run winery up against any of the larger operations in the area. They are a fantastic example of a true gem amongst the large number of options in the Willamette Valley. If we return to this area, we will certainly make another stop here!</td>

The savoir vivre is my favorite red of them all. A silky, well-balanced Pinot noir with warm cherry notes and just the right amount of dryness. I paired it with a braised duck the other night and it was absolutely delightful.
For white, their Pinot Gris is my go-to. Acidic, fruit forward, bright, refreshing- perfect wine for a hot, sunny day. I love how well-rounded it is because it’s something both my Chardonnay and Sav blanc drinking friends can enjoy. Personally, I think it goes best with a nice seafood or spicy Thai dish.
Not to mention the grapes are organically grown and their wine is certified as salmon safe. So if you’re an environmentally conscious wine lover,  you’re in the right place! John and Amber are lovely people and their passion for wine shines through. Go support this family-owned business, folks. You won’t regret it!</td>

The owners were incredibly down-to-earth, friendly and knowledgeable and the wine was AMAZING, especially the Pinot Rose! Boyd made some delicious smoked briquette and Cassandra made a wonderful Cabernet Chocolate Truffle ball.
As a bonus, we got to hear the story of their Hollywood room which was quite interesting and very unexpected. Would highly recommend visiting and we will definitely be going back soon. A hidden gem of Oregon wine!</td>

Jena provided excellent support in organizing and coordinating our event in a warm and professional manner, we couldn’t have done it without her.

Pros:
- The staff was super nice, very helpful, and knowledgeable
- The place is nice but that’s all so con, see below
- The wine is very drinkable and quite delicious
- good location, not too far out and within a short distance of several other stunning wineries.
Cons:
- While the winery is beautiful it has the same fault as all many of the newer wineries, sterile, lack of character, almost cookie cutter design
- The wine is overpriced. When your intro Pinot is $65, you’ve priced yourself out. There are way too many good wines for less to waste time here. This is a personal issue I have with the newer wineries (especially those backed by the mega producers)
Overall it’s worth the tasting fee ($20), but maybe after you’ve exhausted the rest of your list.</td>

              <td>RUDE HOST. Ive heard so many good things from friends about this winery, but it was ruined right from the start by the discourteous host.
We parked in the side parking lot and wandered around the back deck admiring the view. We eventually meandered inside through the back door, and checked out the impressive interior of the tasting room.
The host couldnt be bothered to greet us upon entering, and stood at the host stand the entire time after we entered. We were the only people in the inside area at the time, and only one 3 top seated outside.
When we approached the fella, he asked if wed ever been there before.
I said no, but Id heard good things.
He said wed obviously not been there before because we &quot;came in the wrong way.&quot;
Didnt realize there was a right and wrong way to approach this place, so we immediately felt that his attitude was wholely unnecessary.
He never once looked at either of us directly, which I thought was a bit pretentious, but his pompous attitude made us feel unwelcome from the outright.
After opting to sit outside, he instructed my friend and I to go find a table and someone would be out shortly.
We sat at our table and waited, and waited, waited some more, and watched another young lady tend to the 3 top table outside that was already established before we arrived. No hospitality was directed towards my friend and I.
We waited over 15 minutes before the same host finally came to our table and brought some water. It was a hot Southern Oregon afternoon, so I felt the wait for hydration was a bit intentional by our trollish little host friend to make us feel totally unwelcome.
Regardless, we were quite hungry after having a pleasant river float that afternoon, but also wanted to enjoy a few flights of wine.
Again, Ive never visited this winery but have heard good things.
He told us that the food service was over for the day, which we thought was odd since they werent closing for over another hour.
Ultimately, we opted to leave at that point because the service was so poor, and this dudes attitude was less than accommodating.
This review is coming from a 25+ year service/ hospitality industry worker, so I hate to leave a bad review, but this was worthy of a negative review if I could.
If any of my staff EVER acted this way towards patrons they would be out of a job.
Plain and simple.
The smarmy, condescending attitude was too much from the host, blatant horrible service, and Ill make it a point to steer others away from visiting this establishment in the future. 👎👎👎</td>

Learning the history of the winery and getting some insight into the workings of their gravity-fed winery enhanced the experience.  The 2017 Laurelwood Pinot Noir was one of the best quality/price Pinot Noirs during our trip to Oregon.  The Reserve and Vigneto bottlings are quite distinctive as well.  The 2019 Arneis was a refreshing find as a rarely grown grape variety in the US.  Also recommended is their 2016 Rose Brut sparking from 100% Pinot Noir and 2017 Reserve Chardonnay which struck just the right balance for us.  The tasting room and grounds are clean and modern, yet still inviting.  Recommended.</td>

She immediately asked us for our vaccine card.  I don’t want to make this about whether you should or should not be vaccinated but it was apparent it was very important for this winery.  It took me aback that this small place asked me for my card since no other place of business (winery or restaurant) has ever asked me for my card.  As I was messaging another friend that they needed a card this same person asked me if that’s what I was doing. It took all of me to tell her it was none of her business.
We get to the wine tasting part and we have a different person handing that.  He was very personable and made the experience much better.  The wine is good but if you buy a bottle the tasting fee ($25) is not waived.  Just an FYI.  I did end up buying their sparkling because it was delicious.
As a side note, there is a sign in the bathroom that tells you how to wash your hands, to use the towel to open the door and where to put the towel.  It made me feel like a kindergartner.</td>

We visited years ago and Ive been dreaming about it ever since... so while visiting in laws in Portland and taking the kids to the Wings and Waves Waterpark... I found a way to break away for a tiny bit to do a tasting at R Stuart &amp; Company Winery, and Im SO glad I did!
Our poorer was amazing and I could have sat in there talking wine all day (and know Im lame...)!!!  The wine is SO good.  The only downside is that the bottle if youre not a wine club member (which too pricy in its own right) are very expensive, so you cant walk out of there with everything youd want.  But the tasting experience is divine.  They had some really interesting ones this time and Im sure that changes every time you do.

The reservation was really easy as they had openings all day long, but its not what we were told when we arrived:
- we first sat outside, but we were told to move because they were &quot;expecting a group&quot;
- we could not seat elsewhere outside because there was no shade and it was noon.
- we asked to move two seats about three feet to be in the shade and our request was rejected.
- charcuterie board was not available as you have to pre-order them 24 hours beforehand.
The person was just highly unpleasant and made us feel we were not welcome.
We simply left without tasting.
We went to two wineries close by and has a wonderful rest of our day.

              <td>I had such a wonderful time at left coast estate! Thank you, Sue, for taking such great care of us! We ordered flights which was very fun. Im usually a red wine drinker but the whites were not too sweet so I enjoyed them more than usual. The highlight, though, was the queen bee bubbly! Theres some sort of process with their own bees that feeds the yeast that are little balls on the bottom. I think, I dont really remember the science, but it was freakin amazing! One of the best sparkling wines of my life. We also got a couple charcuterie boards which was packed with tasty snacks and cheeses (the onion one was !!! so good, followed by the merlot as my fav). They were very accommodating to keep the nuts in a separate bowl because Im allergic. Though they were out of the Italian meats, the turkey panini with aoli was incredibly flavorful and filling. The service was amazing. Sue was very knowledgeable, attentive but not intrusive, and seemed infested in us having an amazing experience. The scenery is beautiful as well, I didnt know this part of Oregon had a big wine scene (I lived down here for a year six years ago but I was just back visiting). The estate is nestled in rolling hills and farmland with a small body of water as you enter and tall trees around the tasting area. I wish I lived closer, Id be back a billion times, especially for that bubbly!</td>

One downside was that our table on the patio was right next to the pick up spot for the wine club members so there were about 10 cars or so that pulled up (most left running) next to us while we were at our tasting, which the car noise and exhaust was just not the vibe we had expected (felt like we were sitting IN the parking lot) so that detracted slightly from the experience.
The provisions platter (aka charcuterie board) was amazing. Came with three substantial portions of cheese, three meats, many accompaniments and they even offered gluten free crackers! Was not expecting that but was so grateful.
The weather got a little warm during our tasting and our server mentioned that the red wines werent best served outdoors in the heat, which made us feel like we may not have been getting the optimal experience, however all the wines were exceptional and I definitely recommend checking it out.</td>

It appeared to be a side of cauliflower rice and three pieces of turnips. I also ordered a side of ravioli. 100% would pay $28 again for a side of that ravioli, it was incredible!

The visit was all inside even though it was a lovely warm day, the inside is dark and not very warm + welcoming more like a dank neglected cabin but it looks like theyre currently renovating that space 🤷‍♀️ The person pouring was a little dazed? Would disappear for chunks of time with no warning, didnt give us much information and was a bit all over the place and at the end when we went to pay and another reservation had showed up as well and there was a couple that was halfway through-- no one was to be found and we all awkwardly waited for &gt;15 minutes for someone to appear. But at the the of the day we were there for the wine! Our tasting experience was ok, wines were all only very old vintages and marked up $50-90+ more than previously because they were old but honestly for me these  10+ year wines were not really holding up and felt quite thin and oxidized and very fruit forward which isnt my preferred style for pinots so take my review with that large caveat. We bought a couple cases at other places this one was just a huge miss for us and we preferred to pay for the tasting ($100 out of pocket)-- then take anything home. Would have preferred to taste some more recent releases that could be cellared.</td>
