The visit was all inside even though it was a lovely warm day, the inside is dark and not very warm + welcoming more like a dank neglected cabin but it looks like they're currently renovating that space 🤷‍♀️ The person pouring was a little dazed? Would disappear for chunks of time with no warning, didn't give us much information and was a bit all over the place and at the end when we went to pay and another reservation had showed up as well and there was a couple that was halfway through-- no one was to be found and we all awkwardly waited for >15 minutes for someone to appear. But at the the of the day we were there for the wine! Our tasting experience was ok, wines were all only very old vintages and marked up $50-90+ more than previously because they were old but honestly for me these  10+ year wines were not really holding up and felt quite thin and oxidized and very fruit forward which isn't my preferred style for pinots so take my review with that large caveat. We bought a couple cases at other places this one was just a huge miss for us and we preferred to pay for the tasting ($100 out of pocket)-- then take anything home. Would have preferred to taste some more recent releases that could be cellared.",1653419759,False,ChIJY_YvLqs_lVQRQ1JGKPCC-qA

As a member of Harvest Host, we stayed  the night in our motorhome overlooking the South Umpqua River.

Freed Estate Vineyards grow the grapes that produce their wines. I tasted noteworthy vintages from 2014, 2016 and 2018 with my favorite from their 2018 crops. For my palate it was a fabulous year for many of their wines. However,  their newly released 2016 Tempranillo is exceptional.

It is a family run estate and my list of favorable adjectives to describe this family is lengthy.  I found our wine expert, Brian, to be extremely  knowledgeable, welcoming and a pleasure to talk with. I was lucky to meet a few of his family, as well.

She has such a wonderful personality and made us feel so warm and welcomed, a vast contrast to when we were made to feel ""out of place"" at other tasting rooms and wineries. Not only was the wine AMAZING, Natalie was very knowledgeable and passionate about the history and harvest of the grapes. The first time I met Natalie, we came in during a time when the tasting room was not open yet. She welcomed us  and made us feel so comfortable despite the many tasks she was juggling between pours. She was very attentive yet let us enjoy the atmosphere. While she poured, she used her skills to learn more about us and was able to determine our preferences. Needless to say, we walked away with lots of wine that day. Another time we came to Hood River, one of my friends had her golden retriever puppy with her and when we called ahead, Natalie saved a seat outside for us.

One downside was that our table on the patio was right next to the pick up spot for the wine club members so there were about 10 cars or so that pulled up (most left running) next to us while we were at our tasting, which the car noise and exhaust was just not the vibe we had expected (felt like we were sitting IN the parking lot) so that detracted slightly from the experience.

The provisions platter (aka charcuterie board) was amazing. Came with three substantial portions of cheese, three meats, many accompaniments and they even offered gluten free crackers! Was not expecting that but was so grateful.

The weather got a little warm during our tasting and our server mentioned that the red wines weren't best served outdoors in the heat, which made us feel like we may not have been getting the optimal experience, however all the wines were exceptional and I definitely recommend checking it out.",1630904129,False,ChIJYUZE8AI9lVQRTAz6NWyDEk0

My mother is handicapped and is bound to a scooter and we arrived we noticed there were no marked disabled parking spaces and the only parking spaces near entrances did not have a ramp but a small stair. We elected to park in the front so my mom could use her scooter and enter the winery at an entrance that had a small ramp. It was incredibly difficult for her to enter as the parking lot is gravel. However, we made it in and were immediately greeted very rudely being told that we needed to move our car. The rude woman who was working stated that other customers wouldn't be able to enter, which they could, our car was not blocking ANY entrances. They only thing it was blocking was her view out the window. She then suggested we park next to the entrance with the stair (NOT A RAMP) when I reminded her that it was easier for my mother to get in and out on the side with the ramp that did not have a parking spot. Another lovely woman provided the tasting for us and was incredibly kind. I think she could tell that her coworker was being rude, or has had to deal with her attitude in the past. Regardless, I will not be back to this winery due to their lack of consideration for disabled persons.

We ordered flights which was very fun. I'm usually a red wine drinker but the whites were not too sweet so I enjoyed them more than usual. The highlight, though, was the queen bee bubbly! There's some sort of process with their own bees that feeds the yeast that are little balls on the bottom. I think, I don't really remember the science, but it was freakin' amazing! One of the best sparkling wines of my life. We also got a couple charcuterie boards which was packed with tasty snacks and cheeses (the onion one was !!! so good, followed by the merlot as my fav). They were very accommodating to keep the nuts in a separate bowl because I'm allergic. Though they were out of the Italian meats, the turkey panini with aoli was incredibly flavorful and filling. The service was amazing. Sue was very knowledgeable, attentive but not intrusive, and seemed infested in us having an amazing experience. The scenery is beautiful as well, I didn't know this part of Oregon had a big wine scene (I lived down here for a year six years ago but I was just back visiting).

What a unique experience! Literally a wonderland to lose yourself in. I've been to quite a few wineries but nothing like this. There is always something fun and pleasing to the eye to explore around the corner. Games are set up throughout the gardens like cornhole toss, mini golf, mazes, and a musical playground. Cozy and beautiful lounging chairs are hidden along the pathways like a secret garden all to yourself to sit and drink your wine while you enjoy the flowers. Beautiful sculptures and artwork everywhere. Everything has a story. There are even song suggestions to listen to for all the wines. There's outdoor seating where dogs are allowed. Also there's a dog park. Our server Judy was fantastic and the woman working the gift shop and museum was so kind and friendly. The owner is so very interesting, genuine, and fun to talk to. This really is a very interesting and fun experience. I would also like to add that I was immediately warmly greeted with a smile each time I entered a building by the attentive staff. Ps If you have a kid who has phobias of statues or mannequins then the museum isn't the place for them lol.

The food and wine was wonderful. I got the only vegan option on the menu and was not disappointed. I was thoroughly impressed by the vegan quinoa sandwich. It was very fresh and flavorful. I really enjoyed my wine selections. The only dairy free or vegan options for kids are the steak fries. So if you have a kiddo with an allergy to dairy bring them something to snack on.

I visited the tasting room when it was located in Carlton, and had a lovely experience.. I loved the wine I loved the setting, and I loved the service I received. I joined their wine club with a 4 case/year commitment.
Recently the tasting room moved to McMinnville. The space is very lovely. The wine is still delicious.
Unfortunately, every time I have made  reservations and taken friends and other potential members there with me, we have not been treated very kindly. This last time was the final straw. The room was mostly empty, and we asked if our party of 4 could sit in a more comfortable setting where we could chat and enjoy our wines. We were told the space was reserved and waiting for people who had yet to show up, and it is busy on Sundays for member pick up. I told her, I am a member, also here for my pickup. She was so shocked and taken aback by this, she actually reacted as if she had been slapped. It didn't change her mind at all, and so we sat where they told us. The space we requested sat empty for the entirety of our visit. We were treated like second class citizens and they couldn't wait for us to leave. We had to ask for more water, we waited long periods between tastings, and in the end, they still didn't seem to understand I was an actual member of their wine club. They did not ask us if we wished to purchase anything, or ask us what we thought of the wine. But they were sure to keep asking if there was anything else we needed as they moved my shipment closer and closer to me - once they got it right. .
With so many options available I will not be returning to Troon. My Membership has been cancelled, my experience shared with them, and now with you, and I will take my newly available wine budget to a place that appreciates their members.",1646080354,False,ChIJeeQKRWI4lVQRAbyV6ExOZkE

I especially enjoyed the Chardonnay and brought a bottle home to remember our time!  Quite a few of my family members bought additional bottles on our way out as we thanked Lynette for her hospitality!

The only thing to be aware of is that the drive up is very steep on a gravel road (to be expected at a Vineyard!) so bring your vehicle that can grip the road on the way up.  But the reward at the top of the hill is MORE than worth it.

Just do it.  Enjoy the wine and enjoy the view.

I have been craving their waffles for so long and the summertime was definitely busier for guests and berry picking so what better time to visit than now as things sort of wind down! Don’t get me wrong - it was still hot and nice as ever and busy but manageable and not overly crowded! Their waffles are so crispy and fluffy and packed with whatever in season fruits they have. The strawberries were sweet and perfectly paired with the real whipped cream. The waffles come in at $14.50 I believe a fair price for portion and experience. There is also a drive thru waffle section if you’re wanting to eat in your car or grab and go. They have a winery and eatery as well that has other food to enjoy (but seriously - their waffles are where it’s at!).

The retail and bakery has all the other goodies like pies, baked goods, apples, frozen pies, frozen pizzas, jams, knickknacks and great gifts!

Couple this with a glass of wine and you have a wonderful place to spend part of an afternoon and to pick up a few bottles to take home.  We are primarily red wine drinkers, but in my opinion, the standout here is a white Albariño variety.  It's mostly found in Northwest Spain, but was a pleasant surprise to find it being made locally.
Unless you cross the river near Portland, there are toll bridges involved in visiting AniChe, but a few bucks extra is well worth it for excellent wine and glorious views.

The savoir vivre is my favorite red of them all. A silky, well-balanced Pinot noir with warm cherry notes and just the right amount of dryness. I paired it with a braised duck the other night and it was absolutely delightful.

For white, their Pinot Gris is my go-to. Acidic, fruit forward, bright, refreshing- perfect wine for a hot, sunny day. I love how well-rounded it is because it’s something both my Chardonnay and Sav blanc drinking friends can enjoy. Personally, I think it goes best with a nice seafood or spicy Thai dish.

Not to mention the grapes are organically grown and their wine is certified as salmon safe. So if you’re an environmentally conscious wine lover,  you’re in the right place!

Jonathan Schultz,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100223334890328667154/reviews,en,5,a month ago,"After hearing about the wine and food pairing menu created by the amazing Sarah Pliner, a few friends and I finally were able to attend.

All of the courses were stunning, and we were impressed by how well the coursed paired with selected wines. I really enjoyed the surprising flavours and textures that Sarah experimented with - especially the diced pear with chanterelles and pasta.

Like always, the atmosphere is quite inviting, and Fullerton's patio is just a lovely place to sit with friends, food, and wine.

Our group did have some feedback, though:
1. The service experience could be improved. We were approached and served by almost all staff (whom we love), but being served by one server plus the winemaker would have been a better experience than being served by several people.
2. The ambience/aesthetic should be improved. Silverware was often forgotten about, and placed in a rush - often incorrectly. Glassware was often also placed weirdly, and it would be nice to have a dump cup for wine. Further, getting better quality silverware (Ikea flatware was used) would be a great improvement to complement the nice plates used.
3. Since it was not too busy, it would have been awesome to have the Chef come out to introduce the courses, or to chat with us after finishing the food. The cadence in which courses came was also a little too fast, since we often were not finished courses or wine tastings before the next item was brought to us. There were also a few times where servers did not know what they were serving, so having one person as the go-to for course overviews would be better.
4. Improving the table experience would be nice. Including table cloths and black linens and decluttering the table would have been nice, since there were a few decorations, and the candle was never lit.

Otherwise, I would totally recommend this experience to anyone who wants to enjoy amazing seasonal food with some great local wine. Thank you so much for launching this experience - we cannot wait to see what comes next!",1663959120,False,ChIJOdxWwY4NlVQRqwTEexRZfJo

- While the winery is beautiful it has the same fault as all many of the newer wineries, sterile, lack of character, almost cookie cutter design
- The wine is overpriced. When your intro Pinot is $65, you’ve priced yourself out. There are way too many good wines for less to waste time here. This is a personal issue I have with the newer wineries (especially those backed by the mega producers)

We parked in the side parking lot and wandered around the back deck admiring the view. We eventually meandered inside through the back door, and checked out the impressive interior of the tasting room.
The host couldn't be bothered to greet us upon entering, and stood at the host stand the entire time after we entered. We were the only people in the inside area at the time, and only one 3 top seated outside.
When we approached the fella, he asked if we'd ever been there before.
I said no, but I'd heard good things.
He said we'd obviously not been there before because we ""came in the wrong way.""
Didn't realize there was a right and wrong way to approach this place, so we immediately felt that his attitude was wholely unnecessary.
He never once looked at either of us directly, which I thought was a bit pretentious, but his pompous attitude made us feel unwelcome from the outright.
After opting to sit outside, he instructed my friend and I to go find a table and someone would be out shortly.
We sat at our table and waited, and waited, waited some more, and watched another young lady tend to the 3 top table outside that was already established before we arrived. No hospitality was directed towards my friend and I.
We waited over 15 minutes before the same host finally came to our table and brought some water. It was a hot Southern Oregon afternoon, so I felt the wait for hydration was a bit intentional by our trollish little host friend to make us feel totally unwelcome.
Regardless, we were quite hungry after having a pleasant river float that afternoon, but also wanted to enjoy a few flights of wine.
Again, I've never visited this winery but have heard good things.
He told us that the food service was over for the day, which we thought was odd since they weren't closing for over another hour.
Ultimately, we opted to leave at that point because the service was so poor, and this dude's attitude was less than accommodating.
This review is coming from a 25+ year service/ hospitality industry worker, so I hate to leave a bad review, but this was worthy of a negative review if I could.
If any of my staff EVER acted this way towards patrons they would be out of a job.
Plain and simple.
The smarmy, condescending attitude was too much from the host, blatant horrible service, and I'll make it a point to steer others away from visiting this establishment in the future. 👎👎👎",1660898562,False,ChIJV4EakXaJxVQRF83dTo7CS3k

Our guide was very good, she had passion and was having fun with us.  Their views outside are what you hope for with a great picture point amongst the vines. Their Noirs... those are incredible.

We went to the flying Dutchman winery planning on getting a tasting on a fine afternoon. In fact, we planned our entire day around a relaxing afternoon tasting some good wine.

Within 3 minutes, we experienced enough rudeness that we decided to leave.

We walked in to wait to be served in a line only to have the server yell, ""OUT THE WAY, COMING THROUGH"" in a very rude tone while we were minding our business in line.

We disregarded it, even though he could have kindly said excuse me.

Then when we were at the front of the line, we mentioned that our hotel had said that we could get complimentary tastings... He rudely said, ""We are not affiliated with them and can't control what they tell you."" And then walked to the next customer without giving us time to respond.

We would have happily paid for the tasting had the server just said nicely that sorry, but they are no longer doing that promotion.

Instead he just rudely scowled at us and didn't even give us a chance to order.

So we left. Will never come back. And are leaving with a terrible taste in our mouth.

This valley, like the Rogue Valley in southern Oregon, provides a warmer wine growing climate. Los Rocosos grapes have an added advantage. They are grown in the dark basalt soil that makes up the Rock District of Milton-Freewater. The Rock District is unique because of its cobblestone-rich soil that allows the vines to root deeper while the dark soil absorbs more solar radiation.  In addition to being a Viticoltore, Roger and Lucinda offer B&B accommodations at this working vineyard. If you are so lucky as to get a reservation, insist Roger make his amazing oatmeal porridge.

Learning the history of the winery and getting some insight into the workings of their gravity-fed winery enhanced the experience.  The 2017 Laurelwood Pinot Noir was one of the best quality/price Pinot Noirs during our trip to Oregon.  The Reserve and Vigneto bottlings are quite distinctive as well.  The 2019 Arneis was a refreshing find as a rarely grown grape variety in the US.  Also recommended is their 2016 Rose Brut sparking from 100% Pinot Noir and 2017 Reserve Chardonnay which struck just the right balance for us.

Our poorer was amazing and I could have sat in there talking wine all day (and know I'm lame...)!!!  The wine is SO good.  The only downside is that the bottle if you're not a wine club member (which too pricy in its own right) are very expensive, so you can't walk out of there with everything you'd want.
